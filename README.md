**Background**

This is my first React project. After learning JavaScript in about two weeks, I was eager to start building websites with React so I decided to create something useful for myself.

**Learning Process**

As a beginner in React, I understand that the code in this project may not be the most elegant but I'm applying many things I've learned in school about how to structure a software product. I do believe that hands-on experience is crucial for learning and improving. This project serves as an learning opportunity for me, allowing me to apply the concepts and techniques that I've learned so far.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this app is to provide a convenient way for my girlfriend and I to keep track of the money we make this summer through Uber Eats and other delivery apps. It will help us manage our earnings effectively while not having to do it a bland old spreadsheet like Excel.
